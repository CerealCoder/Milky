# peluche-starter-kit

This starter kits acts a simple boilerplate for simple front end projects.

It has Sass, Jade, Bourbon and Neat built-in to it.

All you have to do is browse to the dev folder and run npm install then gulp.

All the tasks will run and gulp will watch any changes made to the development files.

Everything is outputed to the root folder.

I suck at writing documentation so feel free to correct me if you stumble upon this and find this documentation awful.

Have fun coding :)

(Peluche is the French for Plush btw, it's cute I know)
